///
/// ```ts
/// // interactiveHandler.ts:229
/// resolveOnce(ctx.buildAllow(freshResult.updatedInput ?? ctx.input))
/// // inProcessRunner.ts:324-328
/// resolve({ ...freshResult, updatedInput: input, userModified: false })
/// ```
///
/// (both quoted from `ast-grep run --lang ts --pattern
/// 'resolveOnce(ctx.buildAllow($$$))'` and `--pattern 'resolve({ ...freshResult,
/// updatedInput: input, userModified: false })'`.) In the teammate copy the
/// spread comes FIRST and the explicit `updatedInput: input` overrides it, so
/// `freshResult.updatedInput` is discarded UNCONDITIONALLY — the tool re-runs
/// on the model's original input. The interactive copy takes the fresh value
/// when there is one, and only falls back to the original through `??`. The
/// same asymmetry decides `decisionReason`: `ctx.buildAllow(input)` with no
/// `opts` builds `{ behavior, updatedInput, userModified }` and nothing else
/// (`PermissionContext.ts:264-284`; contrast `:493`, which passes
/// `{ decisionReason }` explicitly), while the teammate copy's spread carries
/// `freshResult.decisionReason` through. Both are parameterised below off
/// [`crate::types::permissions::PermissionRowSource`], which is the same
/// discriminator CC uses: which builder made the row.
///
/// `acceptFeedback`/`contentBlocks` ride the spread in principle and are not
/// ported into it, because `hasPermissionsToUseTool` never produces them —
/// `grep -n "acceptFeedback\|contentBlocks" src/utils/permissions/permissions.ts`
/// is empty; they exist only on decisions built by `handleUserAllow` /
/// `cancelAndAbort`.
///
/// Three statements of the interactive copy have no counterpart here, each
/// ruled rather than ported:
///
/// - `:223-225` `bridgeCallbacks.cancelRequest(bridgeRequestId)` — the CCR
///   bridge (`bridge/bridgePermissionCallbacks.ts`) is unported; there is no
///   remote prompt to dismiss. It comes back with the bridge, not before.
/// - `:226` `channelUnsubscribe?.()` — the channel relay IS ported, but its
///   registration is owned by the asking query
///   (`query.rs:3208` holds a [`ChannelPermissionRelayRegistration`] whose
///   `Drop` unsubscribes), so the row resolving here drops the asker's
///   registration by RAII on the same event. There is no per-row handle to
///   call, and adding one would duplicate the owner.
/// - `:228` `ctx.logDecision({ decision: 'accept', source: 'config' })` —
///   analytics. Standing ruling: `logEvent` bodies are bookkeeping only
///   (`permission_logging.rs` records the event names without sending), and
///   `PermissionDecisionLogArgs::AcceptConfig` is already the entry for this
///   exact call. No decision rides on it.
///
/// `ctx.toolUseContext` is the ASKER's context, and the entry carries it
/// (`ToolUseConfirm.asking_tool_permission_context`, CC's `toolUseContext`
/// field at `PermissionRequest.tsx:142`, installed at the push by
/// `interactiveHandler.ts:97` / `inProcessRunner.ts:230`). `None` means the
/// asker is the REPL itself, whose context is the leader's live one.
///
/// That distinction is load-bearing, not decorative. #179 claimed the
/// difference was conservative — "the transform only ever widens the mode, so
/// this can miss a re-allow, never invent one". **That claim does not hold**,
/// in two independent ways, both read off `agentGetAppState` itself:
///
/// 1. `runAgent.ts:421-434` overrides the mode with
///    `agentDefinition.permissionMode` whenever the parent is NOT in
///    `bypassPermissions` / `acceptEdits` / `auto`. A `plan` agent under a
///    `default` leader is therefore NARROWER than the leader, not wider
///    (`run_agent.rs#agent_permission_context_for_run`, same branch).
/// 2. `runAgent.ts:469-478` REPLACES `alwaysAllowRules` with
///    `{ cliArg: <parent's cliArg>, session: allowedTools }` when
///    `allowedTools` is provided. The parent's `user`/`project`/`local`/
///    `flag`/`policy`/`command`/`session` allow rules are dropped from the
///    agent's context — so the leader's live context is strictly wider there,
///    and a recheck against it could allow a tool the agent's own context would
///    still have asked about. This is not a mode widening at all.
///
/// Deliberate narrowings, both stated rather than hidden:
///
/// - **Only entries that carry a resolver can be resolved.** Every production
///   row now carries one — a nested query's over the sink's channel, the REPL's
///   own over `QueryCommand::PermissionResponse` to the handle that raised it
///   (`screens/repl.rs`, `QueryEvent::PermissionRequest`). What is left without
///   one is the scripted `pending_responses` runtime's row
///   (`the_scripted_runtimes_rows_carry_no_resolver`), which no sweep can
///   settle and which is never withdrawn either — withdrawing without resolving
///   would strand the caller, strictly worse than a prompt the user answers.
/// - **An agent row's carried context is a SNAPSHOT where CC's is a live
///   closure.** `agentGetAppState` re-reads the parent store and re-applies the
///   transform on every call, so CC's recheck for an agent row sees a leader
///   grant made after the agent started. This port computes the agent context
///   once, at run start (`run_agent.rs:749-849`), and hands that same value to
///   the child query — so re-evaluating the row against it reproduces exactly
///   what the ASKING query itself would now decide, which is the property the
///   sweep needs. The cost is the conservative direction only: a leader's "don't
///   ask again" does not auto-approve an in-flight agent row. Closing it means
///   making the agent's whole permission context live, which is a different
///   (and larger) divergence than this one.
/// - Rows relayed to an out-of-process worker's leader
///   (`mailbox_response_target`) carry no context: the asker is in another
///   process. They also carry no `responder`, so they never reach the
///   evaluation below.
///
/// Returns `true` when the entry was resolved (CC's `decisionMade = true`).
