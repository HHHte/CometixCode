//! Maps to: CC `state/store.ts` — the ~35-line framework-agnostic external
//! store that backs AppState.
//!
//! Deliberately independent of iocraft: CC shares the exact same store type
//! between the interactive React tree (`components/App.tsx`) and the headless
//! SDK path (`main.tsx:3728`). CometixCode preserves that property so a future
//! print mode (`-p`) reuses this store without a render loop. The TUI is wired
//! in via `state::app_state`.
//!
//! Semantics mirrored 1:1 from `store.ts#createStore`:
//! - `set_state` runs the updater against the latest root; `Same` = CC's
//!   updater returning `prev` (`Object.is` short-circuit, `store.ts:23`),
//!   `Replace` installs the fresh root then runs `on_change` BEFORE
//!   notifying listeners. A value-equal NEW root installs and notifies —
//!   the CC `{...prev}` spread semantics (B3 flip complete 2026-08-02).
//! - Listeners receive no arguments — change granularity is the consumer's
//!   concern (CC: `useSyncExternalStore` selector; Rust: full re-render or
//!   memo pruning).
//!
//! P3 B2 (Contract A clauses 2-6): every mutation runs inside the
//! process-wide re-entrant [`StoreTurn`] (CC one event-loop turn); the
//! updater and all effect callbacks run with NO lock held; the listener
//! registry is a live insertion-order `Arc`-identity set (CC `Set`,
//! `store.ts:15,26,29-32`) with stateless-identity [`Unsubscribe`] handles
//! and generation-cursor live iteration; panic boundaries per clause 5 are
//! structural (install-before-effects + unwind + RAII turn release, no
//! poisoning).
//!
//! The only equality anywhere in this store is root identity
//! (`Arc::ptr_eq` ≙ `Object.is`); no field-level or value-level comparison
//! exists (Contract A clause 1).
